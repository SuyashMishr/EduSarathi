While individual \norganisms die without fail, species continue to live through \nmillions of years unless threatened by na !ural or anthropogenic \nextinction. Reproduction becomes a vital process without \nwhich species cannot survive for long. Each individual leaves \nits progeny by as exu at or sexua I me a ns.

A related \nperspective on human reproductive health and how \nreproductive ill health can be avoided is also presented to \ncomplete our understanding of biology ofreproductiort. \n\n_I \nPANC HAAAN MJ~..H ES HWARI \n(1904-1966) Bom in November 1SD4 in Japur (Raja;than) Panchanan Maheshwai \nrose to become one of the most distinguished botanists not only of India \nbut of the entire world. He moved to Allahabad for higher education \nwhere he obldned his D.Sc. During hi; college days, he wa; in;p~ed \nby Dr W. Dudgeon. an American missionary teacher, to clevelop interest \nin Botany and especially morphology. His teacher once expressed that \nif his student progresses ahead of him, itwil give him a great satisfaction. \nThese word> encouraged Pcnchanan to enquire what he could do for \nhis teacher in return. \nHe worked on embryological aspects and popularised the u;e of \nembryological chracters in taxonomy. He established the Department \nof Botany, Unilersity of Delhi as an important centre of research n \nembryology and Issue culh.xe. He also emphasised the need for initiation \nof work on artificial culture of immature embryos. These days. tissue \nculture ha; become a landmark in science. His work on test tube \nferlili;alion and intra-ovaricn pollination won worldwide acclaim. \nHe wa; honoured with felowship of Royal Society of london (FRS), \nIndian National Science Academy and several other in;titutions of \nexcellence. He encouraged general education and macle a significant \ncontribution to school education by hi; leadership in bringing out the \nvery first textbooks of Biology for Higher Secondary Schools published \nby NCERT in 1964. \n\ni I \nI \nj \nCHAPTER 1 \nREPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS \n1.1 Asexual \nReproduction \n1.2 Sexual \nReproduction Each and every organism can live only for a cettaln period \nof Ume. The period from birth to the natural death of an \norganism represents Its life span. Life spans of a few \norganisms are given In Figure 1.1. Several other organisms \nare drawn for which you should find out their life spans \nand write in the spaces provided. Examine the life spans \nof organisms represented In the Figure 1.1. Isn't It both \nInteresting and Intriguing to note that It may be as shmt \nas a few days or as long as a few thousand years?

Similarly, a mango tree has a much \nshorter life span as compared to a peepal tree. Whatever \nbe the life span, death of evety Individual organism Is a \ncertainty, I.e., no IndiVIdual Is Immortal , except single-celled \norganisms. Why do we say there is no natural death in \nsingle-celled organisms? Given this reality, have you ever \nwondered how vast number of plant and animal species \nhave existed on eruth for several thousands ofyeru:::? There \nmust be some processes In llvtng organisms that ensure \nthis continuity.
