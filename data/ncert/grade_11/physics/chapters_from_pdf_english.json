Electromagnetic radiation belonging to this region of the\nspectrum (wavelength of about 400 nm to 750 nm) is called light. It is\nmainly through light and the sense of vision that we know and interpret\nthe world around us.\nThere are two things that we can intuitively mention about light from\ncommon experience. First, that it travels with enormous speed and second,\nthat it travels in a straight line. It took some time for people to realise that\nthe speed of light is finite and measurable. Its presently accepted value\nin vacuum is c = 2.99792458  108 m s-1. For many purposes, it suffices\nto take c = 3  108 m s-1. The speed of light in vacuum is the highest\nspeed attainable in nature.\nThe intuitive notion that light travels in a straight line seems to\ncontradict what we have learnt in Chapter 8, that light is an\nelectromagnetic wave of wavelength belonging to the visible part of the\nspectrum. How to reconcile the two facts? The answer is that the\nwavelength of light is very small compared to the size of ordinary objects\nthat we encounter commonly (generally of the order of a few cm or larger).\nIn this situation, as you will learn in Chapter 10, a light wave can be\nconsidered to travel from one point to another, along a straight line joining\n\nPhysics\n310them. The path is called a ray of light, and a bundle of such rays\nconstitutes a beam of light.\nIn this chapter, we consider the phenomena of reflection, refraction\nand dispersion of light, using the ray picture of light. Using the basic\nlaws of reflection and refraction, we shall study the image formation by\nplane and spherical reflecting and refracting surfaces. We then go on ",
